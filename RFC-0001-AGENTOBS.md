## Abstract

Agentic AI systems — applications in which large language models
(LLMs) orchestrate multi-step workflows, invoke external tools, delegate
to sub-agents, and engage in iterative reasoning — produce observability
data that is fundamentally different from, and substantially more complex
than, traditional distributed-systems telemetry.

Yet today there is no broadly adopted cross-vendor standard for what an "AI observability
event" looks like: what fields it carries, how it identifies its place in
a multi-agent trace tree, how cost is attributed across nested steps, how
personally identifiable information (PII) is handled before data reaches a
backend, or how the integrity of an audit trail is guaranteed.

This RFC defines **AGENTOBS** — an open event-schema standard for
observability of agentic AI systems. AGENTOBS specifies:

1. A structured, typed **Event Envelope** that every LLM-adjacent
   instrumentation tool can emit and every observability backend can
   consume.
2. A **Namespace Taxonomy** of thirty-six event types spanning eleven
   domains — ten observability domains (trace, cost, cache, eval, guard,
   fence, prompt, redact, diff, template) and one security domain
   (audit).
3. A first-class **Agent Span Hierarchy** for representing multi-step runs,
   tool invocations, reasoning steps, and decision points as an
   OpenTelemetry-compatible span tree.
4. A vendor-neutral **Provider Normalisation Protocol** that maps raw API
   responses from any LLM provider to the canonical schema in one call.
5. **HMAC-SHA256 Audit Chains** for tamper-evident, compliance-grade event
   integrity.
6. A **PII Redaction Framework** that enforces privacy before event data
   enters any log pipeline.
7. An **Export Abstraction** compatible with OTLP, Datadog, Grafana Loki,
   webhook, and JSONL.
8. **Governance, Deprecation, and Migration** primitives for managing
   schema evolution across a distributed ecosystem of tools.
9. Four **Conformance Profiles** (Core, Security, Privacy, Enterprise)
   that allow incremental adoption — from basic standardised AI spans to
   full compliance-grade audit and governance.

An open reference implementation exists in the llm-toolkit project
(Python), and independent implementations in other languages are
encouraged.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large language models (LLMs) have moved rapidly from experimental
curiosity to production workloads. The operational profile of a production
AI system differs substantially from that of a conventional web service:

- A single user request may spawn **dozens of sequential model calls**,
  each consuming tokens, incurring cost, and potentially interacting with
  external tools.
- Model outputs trigger **guard and safety checks** that may block,
  modify, or re-route the request.
- Intermediate results are stored in **semantic caches** whose hit rate
  directly affects both latency and cost.
- **Evaluation pipelines** run continuously on production traffic to detect
  quality regression.
- **Personally Identifiable Information** (PII) routinely appears in user
  inputs and must be redacted before any data leaves the trust boundary.
- Regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, EU AI Act) require
  **tamper-evident audit trails** for AI-generated decisions.

These requirements cannot be satisfied by general-purpose APM tools
alone. They require a shared event language that is intentionally
designed for the semantics of AI applications.

### 1.2 Scope

This RFC specifies the **event schema standard** — the data model,
serialisation format, identifier scheme, security primitives, privacy
primitives, and export abstractions. It does not mandate a specific
transport protocol beyond requiring compatibility with OTLP/HTTP. It does
not mandate a specific storage backend. It does not mandate a specific
programming language for implementations, though a Python reference
implementation (`llm-toolkit-schema`) is provided.

### 1.3 Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this version:

- Model evaluation methodology (which metrics to use, not how to record
  them)
- Prompt content storage or management
- Fine-tuning pipelines
- Model registry or model card formats
- Inference serving infrastructure metrics

---

## 2. Conventions and Terminology

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL
NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**,
**MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 2.1 Definitions

**Agent** — an AI system that uses an LLM to select and invoke tools,
plan multi-step sequences, and produce a final result through an iterative
reasoning loop.

**Agent Run** — a single end-to-end invocation of an agent, consisting
of one or more ordered steps, each potentially involving model calls, tool
calls, and reasoning activity.

**Canonical JSON** — a deterministic JSON serialisation where object keys
are sorted alphabetically at every nesting level, compact separators
(`","` and `":"`) are used, and `null` values are omitted. This
definition is normative for all signing and hashing operations in this
specification.

**Decision Point** — a branching moment within an agent step where the
agent explicitly chooses among two or more options. Defined in §8.3.

**Event** — the atomic unit of observability defined by this
specification. An Event consists of an Envelope (fixed fields) and a
Payload (namespace-specific data). Defined in §5.

**EventType** — a namespaced string of the form
`llm.<namespace>.<entity>.<action>` that identifies the semantic meaning
of an Event. Defined in §7.

**Exporter** — any component that provides a batch-export operation over
a sequence of Events. This is a structural protocol — no inheritance
or base-class registration is required. Defined in §13.

**Namespace** — one of the defined domains registered in §7.2. Each
namespace owns a set of EventTypes and a set of typed Payload schemas.
Defined in §7.

**Org Secret** — a secret string held by the operator and used as the
HMAC key for signing and verifying an audit chain. MUST NOT appear in
any log, exception, or serialised representation.

**Provider** — an entity that hosts and serves an LLM API. Represented
by the `GenAISystem` enumeration defined in §10.1.

**Reasoning Step** — a discrete unit of chain-of-thought computation
produced by a model that exposes its internal reasoning (e.g., OpenAI
o1/o3, Anthropic Claude extended thinking, Google Gemini thinking mode).
Defined in §8.2.

**Redactable** — a string value annotated with a sensitivity level at
the point of construction, indicating that a RedactionPolicy may replace
it before the Event is written to any log. Defined in §12.

**Sensitivity Level** — a five-level ordinal scale (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`,
`HIGH`, `PII`, `PHI`) used to classify the privacy risk of a field
value. Defined in §12.1.

**Span** — an OpenTelemetry-compatible unit of work with a 128-bit trace
ID, a 64-bit span ID, an optional parent span ID, a start timestamp, and
an end timestamp. Defined in §8.1.

**ULID** — Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier. A
128-bit, time-ordered, zero-coordination identifier.  Defined in §6.

## 3. Problem Statement and Motivation

### 3.1 The Fragmentation Problem

There is currently no broadly adopted standard format for AI
observability events across providers and tooling ecosystems. Many tools,
frameworks, vendors, and enterprise teams define their own log format. The
consequences compound:

| Domain | Consequence of No Shared Schema |
|---|---|
| **Observability** | Dashboards must be rebuilt per service; no cross-service event correlation |
| **Compliance / Audit** | No tamper-evident trail; impossible to reconstruct the exact sequence of AI decisions |
| **Data Privacy** | PII surfaces in logs because no one owns the redaction contract at schema level |
| **Cost Attribution** | Token costs are `Optional[float]` — not auditable, not reproducible 6 months later |
| **Agent Traceability** | Multi-step agent runs are not representable as a coherent span tree in any existing schema |
| **Tooling** | Every new observability tool must write a custom parser for every upstream log format |
| **CI/CD** | Schema drift reaches production silently because there is no compatibility gate |

### 3.2 Why Existing Standards Are Insufficient

**OpenTelemetry (OTel) Semantic Conventions for GenAI** (`gen_ai.*`,
current at time of drafting) define span attributes for individual LLM
calls. They are
necessary but not sufficient:

- They address the individual span, not the agent run as a whole.
- They do not define how cost is structured and attributed.
- They do not define how PII is redacted before span export.
- They do not define how eval scores attach to spans.
- They do not define an audit-chain integrity mechanism.
- They do not define a deprecation or migration protocol for schema
  evolution.

This RFC extends OTel's semantic conventions rather than replacing them.
All AGENTOBS field names in the trace namespace are direct OTel
`gen_ai.*` attribute names wherever a corresponding attribute exists
(§14). Where OTel has no corresponding concept — agent steps, reasoning
steps, decision points, cost breakdowns, redaction records — AGENTOBS
introduces new, OTel-compatible fields.

**In short:** OTel gives you individual LLM spans. AGENTOBS gives you
the agent run that ties those spans together, the cost model that makes
them auditable, the privacy layer that makes them safe to export, and the
audit chain that makes them tamper-evident. If you only need individual
spans, use OTel directly. If you need anything above, you need AGENTOBS.

### 3.3 Design Goals

An AGENTOBS implementation MUST:

1. Be expressible as standard JSON without loss of information.
2. Require no mandatory runtime dependencies beyond what is needed to
   parse and produce JSON.
3. Be fully compatible with the W3C Trace Context specification [W3C-TC].
4. Produce span representations that OTel-aware backends (such as
   Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Datadog APM, Honeycomb) can generally render
   without AGENTOBS-specific knowledge.
5. Be implementable in any programming language.

---

## 4. Design Principles

The following principles are normative for all AGENTOBS implementations.
They are stated as principles rather than rules because they govern the
*intent* behind specific rules elsewhere in this document.

### P1 — Zero Mandatory Dependencies

The core event creation, validation, signing, and redaction operations
MUST be implementable using only the standard library of the target
programming language. Optional integrations (Pydantic models, OTel SDK
wiring, Kafka ingestion) MAY require additional packages but MUST be
isolated behind optional install targets.

**Rationale:** A foundational schema library that imposes dependencies
becomes a dependency conflict waiting to happen. Every downstream tool
inherits those conflicts.

### P2 — Immutability After Construction

Once an Event has been constructed and validated, its Envelope fields
MUST be read-only. Any attempt to mutate an Envelope field MUST raise an
error immediately.

**Rationale:** Events are passed across module, process, and service
boundaries. If any consumer could mutate an event after creation, signed
audit chains would become unreliable, and the tamper-evidence guarantee
of §11 would be invalidated.

### P3 — Deterministic Serialisation

`Event.to_json()` MUST always produce byte-for-byte identical output for
the same Event, regardless of programming language version, operating
system, or call time. Keys MUST be sorted alphabetically at every nesting
level. `null` values MUST be omitted. Datetimes MUST be
formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ffffffZ` (ISO 8601 with lower-case
time designators indicating hours, minutes, seconds).

**Rationale:** The HMAC signature defined in §11 is computed over the
Canonical JSON of the payload. Non-deterministic serialisation would make
signing and verification produce different results on different machines,
rendering the audit chain useless.

### P4 — Typed Exceptions

Every validation failure MUST raise a typed exception carrying three
structured fields: the field name, the received value, and a human-readable
reason. Bare `ValueError("bad input")` exceptions and bare `assert`
statements MUST NOT be used in conformant implementations.

**Rationale:** Structured exceptions are machine-parseable. Downstream
tooling can inspect the exception's fields to produce actionable error
messages without parsing a string.

### P5 — Namespace-Based Event Types

Standard AGENTOBS EventType strings MUST follow the pattern
`llm.<namespace>.<entity>.<action>`. Extension EventTypes MAY use
reverse-domain namespaces (for example `com.example.<entity>.<action>`)
and MUST NOT use unregistered `llm.*` namespaces.

**Rationale:** Namespace-based strings enable prefix routing
(`e.event_type.startswith("llm.guard.")`), prevent naming collisions
between independent tools, and mirror OpenTelemetry's semantic convention
naming scheme.

### P6 — Vendor Neutrality

No specific LLM provider MUST be required or privileged. The schema MUST
support all providers via the `GenAISystem` enumeration (§10.1), and MUST
provide a `_custom` escape hatch for private or enterprise deployments.
Any `_custom` deployment MUST be annotated with a `custom_system_name`
field; `_custom` MUST NOT be used as a silent catch-all.

**Rationale:** Collapsing all unknown providers into `_custom` without
naming makes dashboards unqueryable and cost attribution impossible.

### P7 — Privacy at Source

PII redaction MUST be expressible at the field level, at the point of
field construction, not as a post-processing step. The schema MUST
provide a `Redactable` type that carries a sensitivity annotation with
every string value that may contain PII. RedactionPolicies MUST act on
these annotations before event data is written to any log or exported to
any backend.

**Rationale:** Post-hoc redaction loses the context that identifies which
fields are sensitive. Redacting at the data source is the only robust
strategy.

---

## 5. The AGENTOBS Event Envelope

The **Event Envelope** is the outermost, fixed-structure container
applied uniformly to every AGENTOBS-compliant observability event. The
Envelope is logically separate from the **Payload**, which carries
namespace-specific data.

### 5.1 Envelope Field Specification

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | `string` | REQUIRED | MUST be `"2.0"` for this revision; implementations MUST also accept `"1.0"` for backward compatibility |
| `event_id` | `string` | AUTO | ULID (§6); MUST be auto-generated if not provided by caller |
| `event_type` | `string` | REQUIRED | MUST match a registered AGENTOBS type (`llm.<namespace>.<entity>.<action>`) or a registered extension namespace (reverse-domain form) |
| `timestamp` | `string` | AUTO | ISO 8601 UTC with microsecond precision; MUST be set to `now(UTC)` if not provided |
| `source` | `string` | REQUIRED | Pattern `<name>@<semver>` — e.g. `"my-app@1.0.0"` |
| `payload` | `object` | REQUIRED | Non-empty JSON object; namespace-specific |
| `trace_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters — W3C TraceContext compatible |
| `span_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters — W3C TraceContext compatible |
| `parent_span_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters |
| `org_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | Organisation identifier for multi-tenant isolation |
| `team_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | Team within the organisation |
| `actor_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | User identifier or service account that produced the event |
| `session_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | Conversation or request session grouping |
| `tags` | `object` | OPTIONAL | Flat map of non-empty string keys to non-empty string values |
| `checksum` | `string` | OPTIONAL | MUST match `^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$` when present |
| `signature` | `string` | OPTIONAL | MUST match `^hmac-sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$` when present |
| `prev_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL | ULID of the immediately preceding event in an AuditStream |

### 5.2 Validation Rules

An Event MUST be rejected by a conformant validator if any REQUIRED field
is absent, or if any field value violates the constraints in §5.1.

An implementation SHOULD provide a `.validate()` method that raises a
typed `SchemaValidationError` (§4, P4) rather than returning a boolean, so
that upstream code can act on specific field failures.

### 5.3 Serialisation

An implementation MUST provide `to_json()` → `str`, `to_dict()` → `dict`,
`from_json(s: str)` → `Event`, and `from_dict(d: dict)` → `Event`
operations satisfying the determinism requirement in P3.

### 5.4 Example Envelope (Canonical JSON)

```json
{
  "actor_id": "user:alice",
  "event_id": "01HW4Z3RXVP8Q2M6T9KBJDS7YN",
  "event_type": "llm.trace.span.completed",
  "org_id": "org_acme",
  "payload": {
    "duration_ms": 340.5,
    "finish_reason": "stop",
    "input_tokens": 512,
    "model": {"name": "gpt-4o", "system": "openai"},
    "output_tokens": 128
  },
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "source": "my-app@1.0.0",
  "tags": {"env": "production"},
  "timestamp": "2026-03-04T14:32:11.042817Z",
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736"
}
```

---

## 6. Event Identifier: ULID

Every Event MUST carry a ULID as its `event_id`. A ULID is a 128-bit
identifier composed of:

- **48 bits** — millisecond-precision Unix timestamp (most significant
  bits, allowing time-based sorting)
- **80 bits** — cryptographically random bits

ULIDs are encoded as 26-character Crockford Base32 strings
(e.g., `01HW4Z3RXVP8Q2M6T9KBJDS7YN`).

### 6.1 Properties

Compared to UUID v4:

| Property | UUID v4 | ULID |
|---|---|---|
| Time-sortable | No | Yes — 48-bit timestamp prefix |
| Lexicographic order matches chronological order | No | Yes |
| Monotonic within same millisecond | No | Yes (counter increment on collision) |
| Coordination required | No | No |
| Database index locality | Poor | Excellent |

### 6.2 Generation Requirements

An AGENTOBS implementation MUST:

1. Generate ULIDs using the standard Crockford Base32 alphabet.
2. Guarantee monotonic ordering within the same millisecond by
   incrementing the random portion on collision.
3. NOT require an external ULID package — the generation algorithm MUST
   be implementable in any language's standard library.

### 6.3 ULID Validity Check

A string is a valid ULID if and only if:
- It is exactly 26 characters.
- Every character belongs to the set `[0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ]`
  (Crockford Base32).
- The first character MUST be in the range `0`–`7` (the two
  most-significant bits of the 130-bit Crockford Base32 space are always
  zero because a ULID is 128 bits; the maximum valid ULID is
  `7ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ`, representing dates through
  approximately `10889-08-02`).

---

## 7. Event Namespace Taxonomy

### 7.1 Namespace Structure

All standard AGENTOBS EventTypes follow the BNF:

```
event-type    = "llm." namespace "." entity "." action
namespace     = "trace" / "cost" / "cache" / "eval" / "guard" /
                "fence" / "prompt" / "redact" / "diff" / "template" /
                "audit"
entity        = 1*( ALPHA / "_" )
action        = "started" / "completed" / "failed" / "recorded" /
                "detected" / "blocked" / "hit" / "missed" / "step" /
                1*( ALPHA / "_" )
```

Extension EventTypes use reverse-domain namespace prefixes and follow:

```
extension-event-type = reverse-domain "." entity "." action
reverse-domain       = label "." label *( "." label )
label                = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )
entity               = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" )
action               = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" )
```

### 7.2 Built-in Namespace Registry

| Namespace | Payload Type | Observability Domain | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llm.trace.*` | `SpanPayload` / `AgentStepPayload` / `AgentRunPayload` | Model calls, agent runs, reasoning | Frozen v1 / v2 Active |
| `llm.cost.*` | `CostRecordedPayload` | Per-call cost attribution and rollups | Stable |
| `llm.cache.*` | `CachePayload` | Semantic cache hit/miss, TTL, key hash | Stable |
| `llm.eval.*` | `EvalScorePayload` / `EvalRegressionPayload` | Quality scores, regression detection | Stable |
| `llm.guard.*` | `GuardPayload` | Safety classifier output, block decisions | Stable |
| `llm.fence.*` | `FencePayload` | Structured output constraints, retry loops | Stable |
| `llm.prompt.*` | `PromptPayload` | Prompt template versions, rendered text | Stable |
| `llm.redact.*` | `RedactPayload` | PII audit record — categories found, removed | Stable |
| `llm.diff.*` | `DiffPayload` | Prompt/response delta between two events | Stable |
| `llm.template.*` | `TemplatePayload` | Template registry metadata, variable bindings | Stable |
| `llm.audit.*` | `AuditPayload` | Security: key rotation, audit-chain control events | Stable |

### 7.3 Stability Classifications

**Frozen** — No field will be removed or renamed in any minor or patch
release. Breaking changes require a major version bump with a two-release
deprecation window.

**Stable** — Breaking changes are prohibited within a minor version.
Additive changes (new optional fields) are permitted in minor releases.

**Experimental** — Subject to breaking changes in minor releases.
Experimental namespaces MUST carry a warning in all documentation.

### 7.4 Reserved Namespaces

The following prefixes are reserved for future standardisation: `llm.rag.*`,
`llm.memory.*`, `llm.planning.*`, `llm.multimodal.*`, `llm.finetune.*`.
Third-party namespaces MUST use a reverse-domain prefix outside the `llm.*`
tree (e.g., `com.example.custom.event.action`).

### 7.5 Complete Trace Namespace EventTypes

```
llm.trace.span.started
llm.trace.span.completed
llm.trace.span.failed
llm.trace.agent.step          (v2.0+)
llm.trace.agent.completed     (v2.0+)
llm.trace.reasoning.step      (v2.0+)
```

See Appendix B for the complete EventType registry across all namespaces.

## 8. Agent Span Hierarchy

This section constitutes the core extension that AGENTOBS makes beyond
OTel GenAI semconv. It is the primary motivation for a new standard.

### 8.1 SpanPayload (v2.0)

A `SpanPayload` represents a single unit of LLM work — a model call, an
embedding request, a tool execution, or a complete agent invocation.

REQUIRED fields:

| Field | Type | OTel Attribute | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `span_id` | `string` | — | Exactly 16 lowercase hex characters |
| `trace_id` | `string` | — | Exactly 32 lowercase hex characters |
| `span_name` | `string` | `gen_ai.operation.name` + model | Non-empty |
| `operation` | `GenAIOperationName` | `gen_ai.operation.name` | Defined in §10.2 |
| `span_kind` | `SpanKind` | `SpanKind` | Defined in §10.3 |
| `status` | `string` | — | One of `"ok"`, `"error"`, `"timeout"` |
| `start_time_unix_nano` | `integer` | `startTimeUnixNano` | Non-negative |
| `end_time_unix_nano` | `integer` | `endTimeUnixNano` | MUST be ≥ `start_time_unix_nano` |
| `duration_ms` | `float` | — | MUST equal `(end − start) / 1_000_000` ± 1 ms |

OPTIONAL fields: `parent_span_id`, `agent_run_id`, `model` (`ModelInfo`),
`token_usage` (`TokenUsage`), `cost` (`CostBreakdown`),
`tool_calls` (list, MUST default to `[]` not `null`),
`finish_reason` (string — e.g., `"stop"`, `"length"`, `"tool_calls"`;
mapped to `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons` at export per §14.1),
`error`, `error_type`, `attributes`.

**Envelope alignment:** When an Event carries a `SpanPayload`, the
envelope `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `parent_span_id` fields — if
present — MUST be identical to the corresponding fields in the payload.
The payload fields are authoritative for span hierarchy operations; the
envelope copies are OPTIONAL and exist for routing and filtering by
consumers that do not inspect the payload.

### 8.2 ReasoningStep

A `ReasoningStep` represents one discrete chain-of-thought unit emitted
by a model that exposes its reasoning (OpenAI o1/o3, Anthropic Claude
extended thinking, Google Gemini thinking mode).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `step_index` | `integer` | REQUIRED | Zero-based index within the parent span |
| `reasoning_tokens` | `integer` | REQUIRED | Tokens consumed by this step |
| `duration_ms` | `float` | OPTIONAL | Wall-clock time |
| `content_hash` | `string` | OPTIONAL | SHA-256 of reasoning content, encoded as 64 lowercase hex characters (no prefix) |

**Critical Design Decision — Reasoning Content Is Never Stored:**
Raw reasoning content MUST NOT appear in an AGENTOBS event payload. Only
the SHA-256 hash of the content MAY be stored. This decision reflects
three independent requirements:

1. **IP Protection** — internal chain-of-thought representations are a
   proprietary artifact of the model provider and MAY constitute
   confidential information.
2. **Privacy** — reasoning steps often contain re-statements of sensitive
   user context and SHOULD be subject to the same PII treatment as input
   prompts.
3. **Audit Sufficiency** — the hash is sufficient to verify that the
   reasoning content has not been tampered with; the full content is not
   needed in the audit trail.

### 8.3 DecisionPoint

A `DecisionPoint` records an explicit branching decision made by an agent
during a step.

| Field | Type | Required | Valid Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `decision_id` | `string` | REQUIRED | Unique within the agent run |
| `decision_type` | `string` | REQUIRED | `"tool_selection"`, `"route_choice"`, `"loop_termination"`, `"escalation"` |
| `options_considered` | `List[string]` | REQUIRED | Options the agent evaluated |
| `chosen_option` | `string` | REQUIRED | The selected option |
| `rationale` | `string` | OPTIONAL | Absent for black-box models that do not expose reasoning |

### 8.4 AgentStepPayload

Represents one iteration of a multi-step agent loop. MUST link into the
same span tree via `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `parent_span_id`.

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_run_id` | `string` | REQUIRED |
| `step_index` | `integer` | REQUIRED — zero-based |
| `span_id` | `string` | REQUIRED — 16 hex chars |
| `trace_id` | `string` | REQUIRED — 32 hex chars |
| `parent_span_id` | `string` | OPTIONAL |
| `operation` | `GenAIOperationName` | REQUIRED |
| `model` | `ModelInfo` | OPTIONAL |
| `token_usage` | `TokenUsage` | OPTIONAL |
| `cost` | `CostBreakdown` | OPTIONAL |
| `tool_calls` | `List[ToolCall]` | REQUIRED — empty list if none |
| `reasoning_steps` | `List[ReasoningStep]` | REQUIRED — empty list if none |
| `decision_points` | `List[DecisionPoint]` | REQUIRED — empty list if none |
| `status` | `string` | REQUIRED |
| `start_time_unix_nano` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `end_time_unix_nano` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `duration_ms` | `float` | REQUIRED |

### 8.5 AgentRunPayload

Root-level summary event for a complete agent run. Emitted as
`llm.trace.agent.completed` when the final step resolves.

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_run_id` | `string` | REQUIRED — stable across all steps of this run |
| `agent_name` | `string` | REQUIRED — human-readable agent identifier |
| `trace_id` | `string` | REQUIRED |
| `root_span_id` | `string` | REQUIRED — the root span containing all children |
| `total_steps` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `total_model_calls` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `total_tool_calls` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `total_token_usage` | `TokenUsage` | REQUIRED — aggregated |
| `total_cost` | `CostBreakdown` | REQUIRED — aggregated |
| `status` | `string` | REQUIRED — `"ok"`, `"error"`, `"timeout"`, `"max_steps_exceeded"` |
| `start_time_unix_nano` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `end_time_unix_nano` | `integer` | REQUIRED |
| `duration_ms` | `float` | REQUIRED |
| `termination_reason` | `string` | OPTIONAL — human-readable |

### 8.6 Span Tree Rendering

Because every span in an AGENTOBS agent run carries `trace_id`,
`span_id`, and `parent_span_id` with W3C TraceContext-compatible
representations, OTel-aware backends can generally render the complete agent
span tree without any AGENTOBS-specific knowledge. Each agent step is a
child span of the root `AgentRunPayload` span, and model calls within a
step are children of the step span. This recursive parent-child structure
is the same structure used by most OTel instrumentation libraries —
AGENTOBS agents are simply first-class OTel spans.

**Why parent/child links, not embedded lists:**

An alternative design would embed all child spans as a nested list on the
parent event. This was rejected because:

1. Backends such as Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Datadog APM, and Honeycomb
  commonly rely on parent/child relationships encoded as
  `parent_span_id` on child
   spans. Embedding would require every backend to implement a custom tree
   reconstruction step.
2. Emitting child spans independently allows streaming backends to begin
   processing before the root span completes.
3. It aligns with the core OTel trace model.

---

## 9. Token and Cost Model

### 9.1 TokenUsage

`TokenUsage` covers common token categories exposed by current major LLM
providers. All fields beyond `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and
`total_tokens` are OPTIONAL to accommodate providers that do not expose
granular breakdowns.

| Field | Type | OTel Attribute | Provider Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input_tokens` | `integer` | `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | OAI: `prompt_tokens`, Anthropic: `input_tokens` |
| `output_tokens` | `integer` | `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | OAI: `completion_tokens`, Anthropic: `output_tokens` |
| `total_tokens` | `integer` | — | Sum as reported by provider |
| `cached_tokens` | `integer` | — | OAI: `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, Anthropic: `cache_read_input_tokens` |
| `cache_creation_tokens` | `integer` | — | Anthropic: `cache_creation_input_tokens` |
| `reasoning_tokens` | `integer` | — | OAI: `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` |
| `image_tokens` | `integer` | — | Providers that expose multimodal token counts |

**Naming rationale:** `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` (not
`prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens`) is required because:

1. OTel semconv 1.27 defines `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` and
   `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`.
2. Anthropic's API uses `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` natively.
3. In agentic contexts with multi-turn memory, "prompt" is semantically
   ambiguous — what the user typed is not the same as the full context
   window sent to the model.

### 9.2 ModelInfo

| Field | Type | OTel Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system` | `GenAISystem` | `gen_ai.system` | Enum; replaces `provider: str` |
| `name` | `string` | `gen_ai.request.model` | Model as requested by caller |
| `response_model` | `string` | `gen_ai.response.model` | OPTIONAL; differs in gateway/fallback |
| `version` | `string` | — | OPTIONAL |
| `custom_system_name` | `string` | — | REQUIRED when `system == _custom` |

### 9.3 CostBreakdown

A `float` is not a cost record. A cost record without per-category
breakdown is not auditable. `CostBreakdown` is a typed value object that
makes cost attribution transparent and reproducible.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `input_cost_usd` | `float` | REQUIRED — cost for input/prompt tokens |
| `output_cost_usd` | `float` | REQUIRED — cost for output/completion tokens |
| `cached_discount_usd` | `float` | OPTIONAL — cache savings (stored as positive; subtracted from total); default `0.0` |
| `reasoning_cost_usd` | `float` | OPTIONAL — cost for reasoning tokens; default `0.0` |
| `total_cost_usd` | `float` | REQUIRED — MUST equal `input + output + reasoning − cached_discount` ± 1e-6 (absolute tolerance) |
| `currency` | `string` | OPTIONAL — ISO 4217; default `"USD"` |
| `pricing_date` | `string` | OPTIONAL — ISO 8601 date of the pricing snapshot |

**Zero-fill allowance:** Implementations that do not yet have access to
pricing data MAY populate all cost fields with `0.0`, provided the
`CostBreakdown` object is structurally valid (all REQUIRED fields
present, `total_cost_usd` equals the sum formula). This allows teams to
adopt the schema immediately and backfill pricing logic later.

**Why `CostBreakdown` is not a bare float:**

1. A single float cannot satisfy a compliance audit question like "how
   much did response generation cost versus cached input tokens?"
2. Nested agent chains require cost attribution at each step and rollup
   at the run level; a scalar float cannot represent this hierarchy.
3. Provider prices change. A cost record recorded today that does not
   capture the pricing in effect at the time of the call cannot be
   reproduced or audited six months later.

### 9.4 PricingTier

Stores the exact pricing rates used to compute a `CostBreakdown`, so cost
calculations remain reproducible indefinitely.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `system` | `GenAISystem` | Provider |
| `model` | `string` | Model name |
| `input_per_million_usd` | `float` | USD per 1M input tokens |
| `output_per_million_usd` | `float` | USD per 1M output tokens |
| `cached_input_per_million_usd` | `float` | OPTIONAL |
| `reasoning_per_million_usd` | `float` | OPTIONAL |
| `effective_date` | `string` | ISO 8601 date these rates were valid |

---

## 10. Provider Normalisation Protocol

Different LLM providers return response objects with different field
names, token category names, and cost representations. The provider
normalisation layer maps raw provider responses to the canonical schema
in one call, ensuring that instrumentation code is provider-agnostic.

### 10.1 GenAISystem Enumeration

All provider identifiers in AGENTOBS MUST use the `GenAISystem`
enumeration, which maps directly to OTel semconv `gen_ai.system` values.

| Value | Provider | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | OpenAI | |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic | |
| `cohere` | Cohere | |
| `vertex_ai` | Google Cloud Vertex AI | |
| `aws_bedrock` | Amazon Bedrock | |
| `az.ai.inference` | Azure AI Studio / GitHub Models | |
| `groq` | Groq | |
| `ollama` | Ollama | |
| `mistral_ai` | Mistral AI | |
| `together_ai` | Together AI | |
| `hugging_face` | Hugging Face | |
| `_custom` | Private or enterprise deployment | Requires `custom_system_name` |

**Why an enum, not a free string:**

1. Typo safety — `"OpanAI"` passing silently makes dashboards
   unqueryable.
2. Exhaustive pattern matching — tooling can verify all providers are
   handled.
3. Direct OTel alignment — no translation layer at export time.
4. The `_custom` escape hatch handles everything else without losing
   structural validation.

### 10.2 GenAIOperationName Enumeration

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `chat` | Conversational completion |
| `text_completion` | Single-turn text completion |
| `embeddings` | Embedding generation |
| `image_generation` | Image synthesis |
| `execute_tool` | Tool / function call execution |
| `invoke_agent` | Sub-agent delegation |
| `create_agent` | Agent instantiation |
| `reasoning` | Isolated reasoning / thinking step |

### 10.3 SpanKind Enumeration

Maps to OTel `SpanKind` values relevant to LLM operations.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CLIENT` | Outbound LLM API call — most common |
| `SERVER` | Incoming agent request |
| `INTERNAL` | Internal reasoning or routing step |
| `CONSUMER` | Tool execution triggered by LLM output |
| `PRODUCER` | Event emitted by an agent for downstream consumption |

### 10.4 ProviderNormalizer Protocol

```
ProviderNormalizer:
  system: GenAISystem
  normalize_model(response: dict) -> ModelInfo
  normalize_tokens(response: dict) -> TokenUsage
  normalize_cost(
    token_usage: TokenUsage,
    model: str,
    pricing: PricingTier?
  ) -> CostBreakdown?
```

This is a **structural protocol** — any object satisfying the above
interface is a valid normalizer, without inheriting from a base class.

A conformant implementation SHOULD provide built-in normalizers for
commonly used providers (for example OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama). A
`GenericNormalizer` that attempts best-effort extraction from unknown
response shapes MUST be provided as a fallback.

### 10.5 normalize_response() Helper

```
normalize_response(
  response: dict,
  system: GenAISystem,
  pricing: PricingTier?,
  custom_normalizer: ProviderNormalizer?
) -> (ModelInfo, TokenUsage, CostBreakdown?)
```

Single call that returns everything needed to populate a `SpanPayload`
from any raw provider response dictionary.

---

## 11. Security: HMAC Audit Chains

### 11.1 Threat Model

The AGENTOBS audit chain is designed to detect:

1. **Modification** — signed event material (`payload`, `event_id`,
   `prev_id` linkage) was changed after signing.
2. **Deletion** — any event was removed from the stream.
3. **Insertion** — a fabricated event was inserted into the stream.
4. **Reordering** — events were rearranged within the stream.

It is NOT designed to provide:

- Entity authentication (who produced an event) — use mTLS or JWT for
  service identity.
- Confidentiality — events are signed, not encrypted.
- Non-repudiation between mutually distrusting parties — the shared
  `org_secret` means any party in possession of the secret could
  theoretically produce valid signatures.

### 11.2 Signing Algorithm

Single-event signing is a two-step computation using only standard
SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA256 primitives (available in any modern programming
language's standard library):

```
step 1:  checksum  = "sha256:"      + SHA-256( canonical_payload_json ).hexdigest()
step 2:  sig_input = event_id + "|" + checksum + "|" + (prev_id or "")
         signature = "hmac-sha256:" + HMAC-SHA256( sig_input, org_secret ).hexdigest()
```

Where `canonical_payload_json` is defined as Canonical JSON per §2.1
applied to the `payload` field only (not the entire envelope, so that
envelope fields like `signature` and `prev_id` are not part of the
signed material and can be added without invalidating the payload
checksum).

Conformant verifiers MUST also validate `event_id` and `prev_id` linkage
as part of chain verification. Envelope fields outside signed material
SHOULD be treated as unauthenticated metadata unless separately signed by
profile extensions.

### 11.3 Audit Chain Construction

An `AuditStream` is an ordered, append-only sequence of signed events
where each event's `prev_id` references the `event_id` of the preceding
event. The signature of each event is computed as shown in §11.2, with
`prev_id` embedded in `sig_input`.

```
event[0]: prev_id=null,          sig = HMAC(id[0] | chk[0] | "")
event[1]: prev_id=event[0].id,   sig = HMAC(id[1] | chk[1] | id[0])
event[2]: prev_id=event[1].id,   sig = HMAC(id[2] | chk[2] | id[1])
  ...                             ...
```

Any modification, insertion, or deletion causes every signature after
that point to be invalidated. An adversary cannot produce a valid chain
without the `org_secret`.

### 11.4 Chain Verification

A conformant implementation MUST provide a `verify_chain(events,
org_secret)` function that returns:

- `valid: bool` — whether the entire chain is intact.
- `first_tampered: string?` — `event_id` of the first event with an
  invalid signature.
- `gaps: List[string]` — list of `prev_id` values that point to a
  missing predecessor (evidence of deletion).
- `tampered_count: integer` — total count of invalidated signatures.

### 11.5 Key Rotation

Key rotation MUST be supported without breaking chain continuity.
A key rotation event (`llm.audit.key.rotated`) MUST be inserted into the
chain before the new key takes effect. Verifiers that receive a
`key_map` argument mapping rotation event IDs to new secrets MUST be
able to verify chains that span multiple key generations.

### 11.6 Implementation MUST Requirements

1. The `org_secret` MUST NOT appear in any exception message, log
  statement, or object debug/string representation output.
2. All signature comparisons MUST use a constant-time comparison function
  to prevent timing-based side-channel attacks.
3. Empty or whitespace-only `org_secret` values MUST be rejected at
   signing time with a `SigningError`, not silently accepted.
4. Signing failures MUST raise a typed `SigningError` — they MUST NOT
   silently produce an unsigned event.

---

## 12. Privacy: PII Redaction Framework

### 12.1 Sensitivity Levels

AGENTOBS defines five sensitivity levels as an ordered scale:

```
LOW  <  MEDIUM  <  HIGH  <  PII  <  PHI
```

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LOW` | Internal-only data; not personally identifying |
| `MEDIUM` | Business-sensitive; should not leave the internal tier |
| `HIGH` | Could indirectly identify an individual |
| `PII` | Personally Identifiable Information (names, email, phone, address) |
| `PHI` | Protected Health Information (HIPAA-regulated) |

### 12.2 The Redactable Type

A `Redactable` is a string value annotated with a sensitivity level AT
THE POINT OF CONSTRUCTION. It carries the sensitivity annotation through
all subsequent operations until a `RedactionPolicy` resolves it.

Conformant implementations MUST guarantee that:

1. `Redactable` content NEVER appears in any exception message, log
  statement, stack trace, or object debug/string representation output.
2. If a `Redactable` value triggers a validation error, the exception
   MUST report only the field name and sensitivity level — not the value.

### 12.3 RedactionPolicy

A `RedactionPolicy` specifies a `min_sensitivity` threshold and a
`redacted_by` label. When applied to a data structure:

- Fields with sensitivity ≥ `min_sensitivity` MUST be replaced with
  `"[REDACTED by <redacted_by>]"`.
- Fields with sensitivity < `min_sensitivity` MUST be passed through
  unchanged.
- Non-`Redactable` fields MUST be passed through unchanged.

### 12.4 Redaction MUST Happen Before Export

A conformant implementation MUST apply the `RedactionPolicy` before
passing events to any `Exporter`. Events containing raw `Redactable`
values with sensitivity ≥ `PII` MUST NOT be written to any persistent
storage without first passing through a `RedactionPolicy`.

### 12.5 Post-Redaction Verification

A conformant implementation SHOULD provide `contains_pii(data)` →
`bool` and `assert_redacted(data, min_sensitivity)` → `void | error`
functions to allow callers to assert that redaction has occurred before
data crosses a trust boundary.

---

## 13. Observability and Export

### 13.1 The Exporter Protocol

Any component that provides a batch-export operation over a sequence of
events is a conformant Exporter. This is a **structural protocol** — no
inheritance or class hierarchy is required.

### 13.2 Built-in Exporters

Conformant implementations MUST define the Exporter protocol and support
at least one interoperable transport. The exporters below are
RECOMMENDED reference mappings and MAY be provided as optional modules.

| Exporter | Transport | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `JSONLExporter` | File I/O | Newline-delimited JSON to local file; optional gzip |
| `WebhookExporter` | HTTP POST | Any HTTP(S) endpoint; headers, retry backoff, timeout |
| `OTLPExporter` | OTLP/HTTP JSON | Any OTel collector; gzip, configurable batch size |
| `DatadogExporter` | Datadog Agent trace API + Datadog metrics API | Datadog APM + metrics |
| `GrafanaLokiExporter` | Loki `/loki/api/v1/push` | Grafana Loki; multi-tenant via `X-Scope-OrgID` |
| `OTelBridgeExporter` | OTel SDK span lifecycle | Any registered `SpanProcessor` |

### 13.3 EventStream

An `EventStream` is an immutable, ordered sequence of events with a
fluent API for filtering and fan-out export.

Minimum required capabilities:

- Filter by predicate.
- Filter by event type.
- Export (drain) to an Exporter.
- Route subsets of events to specific exporters.
- Ingest from persisted event logs.

Implementations SHOULD provide streaming (memory-efficient) ingestion
for large log files.

---

## 14. OpenTelemetry Alignment

### 14.1 Required OTel Mappings

Every `SpanPayload` exported via `OTLPExporter` or `OTelBridgeExporter`
MUST map AGENTOBS fields to the following OTel span fields:

| OTel Field | Source in AGENTOBS Schema |
|---|---|
| `gen_ai.system` | `payload.model.system` |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | `payload.model.name` |
| `gen_ai.response.model` | `payload.model.response_model` |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | `payload.token_usage.input_tokens` |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | `payload.token_usage.output_tokens` |
| `gen_ai.operation.name` | `payload.operation` |
| `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons` | `payload.finish_reason` (or omitted when unavailable) |
| `deployment.environment.name` | `tags["env"]` |
| `span.kind` | `payload.span_kind` |
| Trace-context flags | sampling decision (`01` sampled, `00` unsampled) |
| `endTimeUnixNano` | `payload.end_time_unix_nano` |
| `status.code` | `ERROR` for `"error"/"timeout"`, `OK` for `"ok"` |

### 14.2 W3C TraceContext Compatibility

Conformant implementations MUST provide:

- `make_traceparent(trace_id, span_id, sampled?)` → `string` — produces
  a valid W3C TraceContext `traceparent` header in the form
  `00-<32-hex-trace-id>-<16-hex-span-id>-<flags>`, where `<flags>` is
  `01` (sampled — the default) or `00` (not sampled).
- `extract_trace_context(headers)` → `dict` — parses incoming headers to
  resume a distributed trace.

`trace_id` MUST be exactly 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters (W3C 16-byte trace ID).
`span_id` MUST be exactly 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters (W3C 8-byte span ID).

---

## 15. Governance and Schema Evolution

### 15.1 EventGovernancePolicy

Operators MUST be able to configure blocking and warning rules on event
types at runtime:

- **`blocked_types`** — event types that are hard-blocked; emitting them
  MUST raise a `GovernanceViolationError`.
- **`warn_deprecated`** — event types that are soft-blocked; emitting them
  MUST emit a `DeprecationWarning` but MUST NOT raise.
- **`custom_rules`** — arbitrary callables returning a pass indicator or
  an error string (fail); support complex cross-field governance
  constraints.
- **`strict_unknown`** — if `true`, event types not registered in the
  known EventType set MUST be hard-blocked.

### 15.2 Consumer Compatibility Registry

A `ConsumerRegistry` allows tools to declare their schema version
dependencies at startup and fail fast before processing any events:

```
ConsumerRegistry.register(
  consumer_id: string,
  requires_namespace: string,
  min_version: semver,
  max_version: semver
)
ConsumerRegistry.assert_compatible() -> void | error
```

### 15.3 Deprecation Registry

Every deprecated EventType or field MUST have a `DeprecationRecord`
containing:

- `deprecated_since` — the version in which the deprecation was announced.
- `sunset_version` — the version in which the type will be removed.
- `sunset_policy` — one of `NEXT_MAJOR`, `NEXT_MINOR`, `LONG_TERM`, `UNSCHEDULED`.
- `replacement` — the new EventType or field name.
- `field_renames` — a map of old field names to new field names.

Old types MUST remain importable and MUST emit a `DeprecationWarning`
via the `deprecations` registry. They MUST NOT be fully removed until
the `sunset_version` is released.

### 15.4 Migration Roadmap

Conformant implementations MUST provide a programmatic interface to the
migration roadmap so that operators can audit outstanding migrations
without reading release notes:

```
migration_roadmap() -> List[DeprecationRecord]  # sorted by event_type
```

### 15.5 Schema Version Field

Every Event produced under this revision carries `schema_version: "2.0"`.
Events produced under earlier revisions carry `"1.0"`. Implementations
MUST accept both `"1.0"` and `"2.0"` events but MUST NOT silently ignore
an unrecognised `schema_version` — they MUST raise a
`SchemaVersionError` and stop processing.

---

## 16. Compliance Checks

### 16.1 Built-in Checks

Conformant implementations MUST provide at minimum the following
programmatic compliance checks, executable without a test framework:

| Check ID | What It Verifies |
|---|---|
| `CHK-1` | All required Envelope fields are present on every event |
| `CHK-2` | All `event_type` values are registered EventType strings matching `llm\.<ns>\.<entity>\.<action>` or a registered extension namespace (reverse-domain form per §7.1) |
| `CHK-3` | All `source` identifiers follow the `<name>@<semver>` pattern |
| `CHK-4` | All `event_id` values are valid ULIDs |

### 16.2 Multi-tenant Isolation Checks

For multi-tenant deployments, implementations SHOULD provide:

- `verify_tenant_isolation(events)` — detects cross-tenant data leakage
  (events with different `org_id` values mixed in the same stream).
- `verify_events_scoped(events, org_id)` — asserts all events in a
  stream belong to a single expected organisation.

### 16.3 Chain Integrity Check

```
verify_chain_integrity(events, org_secret) -> ComplianceResult
```

MUST check for tampering, missing `prev_id` links (deletions), and
timestamp non-monotonicity, returning structured results per §11.4.

### 16.4 CI Pipeline Integration

Conformant implementations MUST provide a CLI entry point that can run
compliance checks against a JSON or JSONL log file and exit with a
non-zero status code on failure. The output MUST be both human-readable
and machine-parseable (via `--json` flag).

```
agentobs check-compat events.json
agentobs check-compat events.json --json
```

---

## 17. Schema Validation

### 17.1 JSON Schema

Conformant implementations MUST publish a versioned JSON Schema (Draft
2020-12, or a later backward-compatible revision) at a stable,
well-known path (`schemas/v<version>/schema.json`)
encoding all Envelope field constraints.

**Scope:** This requirement applies to **independent implementations**
(libraries, SDKs) that define their own event-creation and validation
code. Applications that consume events using an existing conformant SDK
do not need to republish the schema — they inherit conformance from the
SDK.

### 17.2 Validation Backends

Implementations MUST support two validation paths:

1. **Full JSON Schema validation** using the published schema file when a
   JSON Schema validator library is available.
2. **Structural stdlib fallback** performing field-type checks without any
   additional dependency.

Both paths MUST raise the same typed `SchemaValidationError` on failure.

---

## 18. Conformance Profiles

The previous sections define the full AGENTOBS capability set. This
section groups those capabilities into **four conformance profiles** so
that implementers can adopt incrementally and claim precise conformance
without implementing every feature at once. Profiles exist to reduce
implementation burden, not to increase it.

An implementation that is a **library or SDK** MUST declare which
profile(s) it conforms to in its documentation and in the output of its
CLI `--version` command (if a CLI is provided). Applications that consume
events using an existing conformant SDK are not required to make formal
profile claims (see §18.6). Profiles are **cumulative** — each higher
profile includes all requirements of the profiles below it.

### 18.1 Core Profile

The Core Profile defines the minimum interoperable AGENTOBS
implementation. It standardises AI spans, token usage, cost attribution,
and agent run telemetry. An implementation claiming **Core** conformance
MUST:

| # | Requirement | Spec Reference |
|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Implement the Event Envelope | §5 |
| C-2 | Generate ULIDs as `event_id` | §6 |
| C-3 | Define and enforce the EventType namespace taxonomy | §7 |
| C-4 | Provide `SpanPayload` | §8.1 |
| C-5 | Provide `AgentStepPayload` and `AgentRunPayload` | §8.4, §8.5 |
| C-6 | Provide `TokenUsage` with `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` naming | §9.1 |
| C-7 | Provide `CostBreakdown` as a typed value object | §9.3 |
| C-8 | Deterministic Canonical JSON serialisation | §4 P3 |
| C-9 | Provide the Exporter protocol and at least one transport | §13.1, §13.2 |
| C-10 | Produce OTel-compatible span attributes at export | §14 |
| C-11 | Publish a versioned JSON Schema file | §17 |

An implementation claiming only Core conformance MAY omit HMAC signing,
`Redactable` types, `RedactionPolicy`, governance primitives, and CLI
compliance checks entirely.

**Intended audience:** Teams that want standardised AI spans and cost
attribution without security, privacy, or governance overhead.

### 18.2 Security Profile

The Security Profile adds tamper-evident audit chains. An implementation
claiming **Security** conformance MUST satisfy all Core requirements AND:

| # | Requirement | Spec Reference |
|---|---|---|
| S-1 | Implement HMAC-SHA256 single-event signing | §11.2 |
| S-2 | Implement audit chain construction (`prev_id` linkage) | §11.3 |
| S-3 | Provide `verify_chain()` with structured results | §11.4 |
| S-4 | Support key rotation without breaking chain continuity | §11.5 |
| S-5 | Use constant-time comparison for all HMAC verification | §11.6 item 2 |
| S-6 | Reject empty or whitespace-only `org_secret` at signing time | §11.6 item 3 |
| S-7 | Prevent `org_secret` leakage (exceptions, logs, debug output) | §11.6 item 1, §19.3 |

**Intended audience:** Teams with compliance or audit requirements (SOC 2,
ISO 27001, financial services).

### 18.3 Privacy Profile

The Privacy Profile adds field-level PII controls. An implementation
claiming **Privacy** conformance MUST satisfy all Core requirements AND:

| # | Requirement | Spec Reference |
|---|---|---|
| P-1 | Provide the `Redactable` type with sensitivity annotation at construction | §12.2 |
| P-2 | Implement the five-level sensitivity scale (`LOW` through `PHI`) | §12.1 |
| P-3 | Provide `RedactionPolicy` with threshold-based redaction | §12.3 |
| P-4 | Apply redaction before any export (`Exporter` integration) | §12.4 |
| P-5 | Prevent `Redactable` content from appearing in exceptions, logs, or debug output | §12.2 |
| P-6 | Provide post-redaction verification functions | §12.5 |

The Privacy Profile does NOT require the Security Profile. An
implementation MAY claim Core + Privacy without implementing HMAC signing.

**Intended audience:** Teams operating under GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, or EU AI
Act obligations.

### 18.4 Enterprise Profile

The Enterprise Profile adds schema lifecycle governance. An
implementation claiming **Enterprise** conformance MUST satisfy **all**
of Core, Security, AND Privacy, AND:

| # | Requirement | Spec Reference |
|---|---|---|
| E-1 | Provide `EventGovernancePolicy` with blocked/deprecated/custom rules | §15.1 |
| E-2 | Provide `ConsumerRegistry` for version-dependency declarations | §15.2 |
| E-3 | Provide `DeprecationRegistry` with sunset tracking | §15.3 |
| E-4 | Provide programmatic `migration_roadmap()` interface | §15.4 |
| E-5 | Provide CLI compliance checks (`check-compat`) with JSON output | §16.4 |
| E-6 | Provide built-in compliance checks CHK-1 through CHK-4 | §16.1 |
| E-7 | Provide chain integrity check | §16.3 |

The Enterprise Profile is a strict superset of all other profiles.

**Intended audience:** Multi-team organisations managing schema evolution
across a distributed ecosystem of tools and services.

```

### 18.6 Conformance Claim Syntax

**Libraries and SDKs** MUST state their conformance using one or more of
the following labels:

- `AGENTOBS-Core-2.0`
- `AGENTOBS-Security-2.0`
- `AGENTOBS-Privacy-2.0`
- `AGENTOBS-Enterprise-2.0`

Multiple profiles MAY be combined (e.g., `AGENTOBS-Core-2.0,
AGENTOBS-Security-2.0` for an implementation that provides audit chains
but not PII redaction). The Enterprise label implies all four.

**Applications** (services, scripts, notebooks) that use an existing
conformant SDK are not expected to make formal conformance claims. They
inherit the profile conformance of the SDK they depend on.

### 18.7 SHOULD Requirements (All Profiles)

Regardless of profile, an implementation SHOULD:

1. Run property-based tests against signing, serialisation, and ULID
   generation.
2. Provide built-in `ProviderNormalizer` implementations for widely used
  providers.
3. Provide framework integrations as optional modules.

### 18.8 MAY Provisions (All Profiles)

An implementation MAY:

1. Provide additional named exporters beyond the required minimum.
2. Provide Kafka ingestion support.
3. Provide additional typed model layers (e.g., Pydantic, TypeScript Zod).
4. Define custom namespaces using a reverse-domain prefix outside
   `llm.*`.

### 18.9 Adoption Guide

This subsection is informative. It summarises practical adoption paths
to help teams get started quickly.

#### 18.9.1 Span-Only Adoption (Minimal Instrumentation)

An implementation that does not perform agent orchestration MAY emit
only `llm.trace.span.*` events and omit `AgentStepPayload` and
`AgentRunPayload` entirely. This is a valid Core-conformant deployment.
The `AgentStepPayload` and `AgentRunPayload` types MUST exist in the
SDK surface for interoperability (C-5), even if the application never
emits those events.

This allows teams that wrap a single LLM call to adopt AGENTOBS without
implementing agent-run bookkeeping.

#### 18.9.2 What You Can Ignore (Core Only)

If you adopt only the **Core Profile**, you MAY ignore these sections
entirely:

- **§11** — Security: HMAC Audit Chains
- **§12** — Privacy: PII Redaction Framework
- **§15** — Governance and Schema Evolution
- **§16** — Compliance Checks
- **§19** — Security Considerations (applies only to Security Profile)
- **§20** — Privacy Considerations (applies only to Privacy Profile)

You only need: Envelope (§5), ULID (§6), Namespaces (§7), Span Hierarchy
(§8), Token & Cost (§9), Export (§13), OTel Alignment (§14), and Schema
Validation (§17).

#### 18.9.3 Quick Start Path

A small team can reach `AGENTOBS-Core-2.0` conformance by implementing
five things:

1. Event Envelope with auto-generated ULID and timestamp
2. `SpanPayload` with `TokenUsage`
3. Deterministic JSON serialisation (sorted keys, no nulls)
4. One Exporter (JSONL to file is the simplest)
5. OTel attribute mapping at export time

A minimal instrumented LLM call looks like this:

```json
{
  "event_id": "01HW4Z3RXVP8Q2M6T9KBJDS7YN",
  "event_type": "llm.trace.span.completed",
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "source": "my-app@1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-04T14:32:11.042817Z",
  "payload": {
    "span_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8",
    "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
    "span_name": "chat gpt-4o",
    "operation": "chat",
    "span_kind": "CLIENT",
    "status": "ok",
    "start_time_unix_nano": 1741099931000000000,
    "end_time_unix_nano": 1741099931340500000,
    "duration_ms": 340.5,
    "model": {"name": "gpt-4o", "system": "openai"},
    "token_usage": {
      "input_tokens": 512,
      "output_tokens": 128,
      "total_tokens": 640
    },
    "cost": {
      "input_cost_usd": 0.0,
      "output_cost_usd": 0.0,
      "total_cost_usd": 0.0
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }
}
```

No signing. No redaction. No governance. That is a complete, valid,
`AGENTOBS-Core-2.0` event.

#### 18.9.4 Migration from Plain Logs

Teams already logging LLM calls as ad-hoc JSON can migrate incrementally.
A typical before/after:

**Before (ad-hoc):**
```json
{"model": "gpt-4o", "tokens": 640, "latency_ms": 340}
```

**After (AGENTOBS Core):**
```json
{
  "event_id": "01HW4Z3RXVP8Q2M6T9KBJDS7YN",
  "event_type": "llm.trace.span.completed",
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "source": "my-app@1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-04T14:32:11.042817Z",
  "payload": {
    "span_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8",
    "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
    "span_name": "chat gpt-4o",
    "operation": "chat",
    "span_kind": "CLIENT",
    "status": "ok",
    "start_time_unix_nano": 1741099931000000000,
    "end_time_unix_nano": 1741099931340500000,
    "duration_ms": 340.5,
    "token_usage": {
      "input_tokens": 640,
      "output_tokens": 0,
      "total_tokens": 640
    }
  }
}
```

The delta is: a standard envelope (5 fields), a structured payload
instead of flat keys, and a ULID instead of no identifier. The data you
already capture maps directly into the payload.

## 19. Security Considerations

### 19.1 HMAC Key Management

The `org_secret` used for HMAC signing is a symmetric secret shared
among all parties authorised to verify the audit chain. Operators MUST:

1. Treat `org_secret` values with the same rigour as database passwords —
   store them in a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS SSM
   Parameter Store, Azure Key Vault), not in source code.
2. Rotate secrets on a schedule consistent with organisational security
   policy, using the key rotation mechanism defined in §11.5.
3. Restrict access to the secret to the minimum set of services that
   must verify the chain.

### 19.2 Timing Attacks

All HMAC digest comparisons MUST use constant-time comparison functions.
Variable-time string comparison (e.g., a naive byte-by-byte equality
check that short-circuits on the first mismatch) leaks information about
the length of the common prefix of two HMAC values, enabling a timing
oracle attack. Implementations MUST use a constant-time digest comparison
primitive (for example, `hmac.compare_digest` in Python,
`crypto.timingSafeEqual` in Node.js, or the equivalent in other
languages).

### 19.3 Secret Leakage Prevention

The `org_secret` MUST NOT appear in:

- Exception messages (`SchemaValidationError`, `SigningError`, etc.)
- Log statements at any level
- Object debug/string representations
- Stack traces
- Any serialised Event field

Implementations SHOULD use a dedicated secret-holder type for
`org_secret` parameters to prevent accidental logging by third-party
libraries.

### 19.4 Denial of Service

Implementations that parse Events from untrusted input (e.g., an HTTP
webhook receiver) MUST:

1. Enforce a maximum event size limit (RECOMMENDED: 1 MB).
2. Enforce a maximum `payload` nesting depth (RECOMMENDED: 10 levels).
3. Enforce a maximum number of `tags` keys (RECOMMENDED: 50).

### 19.5 Reasoning Content

As specified in §8.2, raw reasoning content from chain-of-thought models
MUST NOT be stored in events. Only the SHA-256 hash MAY be stored. This
mitigates the risk of proprietary model artifacts and user PII being
written to observability backends that may have broader access controls
than primary data stores.

---

## 20. Privacy Considerations

### 20.1 GDPR / CCPA Compliance

AI observability pipelines frequently process personal data — user
messages, names, email addresses, phone numbers in prompts. Operators
deploying AGENTOBS-conformant systems in jurisdictions subject to GDPR,
CCPA, or equivalent legislation MUST:

1. Apply a `RedactionPolicy` with `min_sensitivity=PII` before events are
   exported to any backend.
2. Classify all fields that may contain user-supplied text as
   `Sensitivity.PII` at the point of construction.
3. Document the `redacted_by` label in their data processing record.

### 20.2 HIPAA Compliance

For healthcare use cases where PHI may appear in prompts, operators MUST:

1. Apply a `RedactionPolicy` with `min_sensitivity=PHI`.
2. Ensure HIPAA-covered data never reaches a log backend that is not
   itself HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) covered.

### 20.3 Right to Erasure

Because AGENTOBS events are intended to be cryptographically chained,
deleting a specific event from an audit chain invalidates all subsequent
signatures. Operators MUST document this constraint in their privacy
notices and provide a mechanism for producing a _successor chain_ that
excludes the deleted event while preserving the integrity of remaining
events.

### 20.4 Data Minimisation

The `payload` field SHOULD contain only data necessary for the stated
observability purpose. Entire model prompt/response bodies SHOULD NOT be
stored — only hashes, length statistics, and redacted summaries. The
`content_hash` fields on `ReasoningStep` exemplify this principle.

---

## 21. Interoperability Considerations

### 21.1 Language Neutrality

Although the reference implementation is in Python, this specification is
language-neutral. Implementations in Go, Rust, TypeScript, Java, and .NET
are encouraged. The only shared dependencies are:

- A JSON serialiser that supports key sorting.
- A SHA-256 / HMAC-SHA256 implementation (available in every language's
  standard library).
- A Crockford Base32 codec.

### 21.2 Versioned JSON Schema as the Portability Contract

The versioned JSON Schema at `schemas/v1.0/schema.json` is the
normative, language-neutral definition of the Event Envelope. Any
implementation that validates events against this schema is
interoperable with any other conformant implementation.

### 21.3 Backward Compatibility Policy

- **Patch releases** — bug fixes only; no API changes.
- **Minor releases** — additive changes only; new optional fields, new
  EventTypes, new exporters.
- **Major releases** — breaking changes permissible; MUST be preceded by a
  deprecation period of at least two minor releases or six calendar months,
  whichever is longer.

The migration roadmap API (§15.4) allows operators to programmatically
enumerate outstanding breaking changes and plan migration work before a
major release.

## 24. Public Review Questions

The following questions are explicitly opened for public comment before
ratification:

1. **Signature coverage:** Should AGENTOBS define an optional profile that
  signs selected envelope fields in addition to `payload`?
2. **Reasoning privacy:** Is `content_hash` sufficient for auditability in
  regulated environments, or should a sealed escrow profile be defined?
3. **Cost model scope:** Should `CostBreakdown` add non-USD currency
  normalization guidance beyond ISO-4217 labeling?
4. **Namespace governance:** Should third-party extension namespaces be
  registered centrally, or remain fully decentralized?
5. **OTel evolution:** What compatibility policy should AGENTOBS adopt
  when OTel GenAI semantic conventions rename or deprecate fields?
6. **Profile boundaries:** Are the four conformance profiles (Core,
  Security, Privacy, Enterprise) at the right boundaries? Should any
  capability move between profiles?
